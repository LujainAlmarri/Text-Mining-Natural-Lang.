# Text-Mining-Natural-Lang.
This repository contains a collection of labs from the Text Mining &amp; Natural Language Processing course. These labs demonstrate practical applications of NLP concepts, focusing on data analysis, preprocessing, and advanced techniques such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and generative AI.


Lab 1: Data Analysis with Pandas
Exploratory data analysis using Pandas, focusing on text data manipulation and basic statistics.

Lab 2: Text Data Preprocessing (NLP Pipeline)
Building an NLP pipeline, including tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal.

Lab 3: Word Embedding
Exploring word embedding techniques such as Word2Vec and GloVe for semantic representation.

Lab 4: Sentiment Analysis
Developing sentiment analysis models using machine learning techniques.

Lab 5: Topic Modeling
Implementing topic modeling algorithms like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to uncover hidden topics.

Lab 6: Generative AI Use Case - Summarize Dialogue
Leveraging generative AI models to summarize dialogue text and extract key insights
